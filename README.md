# Getting Started

I've added an alias command on your computer to make it easy to start editing. If you open up Terminal and run

```
portfolio
```
It will navigate your terminal to the folder that contains your portfolio site.
You can verifiy you're there by running

```
pwd
```

This stands for "print working directory" and after you run it you should see `/Users/Ana/Documents/anashioshita.github.io`

Now that this is your directory, you can run

```
code .
```

To open this folder in VS Code.

You can also run

```
open .
```

To open a new Finder window at this folder

# Viewing the current site

Run

```
http-server
```

And you'll see

```
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://192.168.0.113:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

Once that displays, you can use either one of those urls, or more simply

```
localhost:8080
```

In any browser to see the current site.
